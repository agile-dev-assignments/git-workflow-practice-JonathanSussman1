This article was interesting to me because it was essentially a walkthrough of the process of creating art by applying the texture and 'style' of one image, to another image, using deep learning. Art being something important to me and deep learning being a concept that I have yet to fully explore, this article demonstrated some neat techniques that I'd like to experiment with in the future. For example, the article gave me a window into the interface of TensorFlow, an open-source platform used for machine learning, along with the Keras Functional API applied with TensorFlow which the author noted was important for training his deep learning module.
